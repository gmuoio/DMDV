# Data Management and Visualization project

Starting from the use of technologies and analytical methods suitable for the management and processing of data on the use of the bike-sharing service in the city of New York, a transversal analysis was conducted that takes into account the seasonality of the phenomenon. and which aims to show how the COVID-19 pandemic in the year 2020 played a role in changing the city's two-wheeled mobility. The results of the analysis show that the use of the bike-sharing service, after the lockdown period in spring 2020, has recovered and exceeded pre-pandemic levels. Users and their usage habits have changed, the service has been rediscovered by many as a way to go out, exercise and also avoid crowding on public transport.
